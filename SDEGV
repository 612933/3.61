yes 
we cant overload a method with different return types but we can do it in c++
There are two ways to overload the method in java
   By changing number of arguments
   By changing the data type
        while  method calling , depending on input parameters it will select which method to excute. It will not check the return type 
        during the method calling. we can overlaod a method by 2 types ,whatever be the return type.
